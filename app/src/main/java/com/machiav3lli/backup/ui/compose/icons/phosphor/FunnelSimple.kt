// This file is a part of the Phosphor package and defines a ImageVector object named FunnelSimple.

// The FunnelSimple object is created using the Builder class and contains a vector path for a simple funnel shape.

// The path is defined using various methods like moveTo, lineTo, and arcTo.

// The path is then filled with a solid color.

// The private variable _funnel_simple is used to store the ImageVector object, to avoid creating it multiple times.

// The @Preview annotation is used to display a preview of the FunnelSimple image vector.

// The FunnelSimplePreview function displays the FunnelSimple image vector using the Image composable.
